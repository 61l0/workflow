                        <p>Case management frameworks (CMFs) are commercial<a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-2F4M3SI&ct=150513&st=sb#dv_1_as_commercial"><sup>1</sup></a> software offerings designed to reduce the time and complexity of creating case-style
                           process solutions by providing architectural patterns and at least some business domain
                           capabilities "out of the box." Work is caselike when each work item — each case —
                           requires unique handling, involving complex interactions between content, people,
                           transactions and business or regulatory policies in order to deliver an optimal outcome.<a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-2F4M3SI&ct=150513&st=sb#dv_2_an_optimal"><sup>2</sup></a> Case-style processes do not progress in a serial or completely predictable fashion.<a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-2F4M3SI&ct=150513&st=sb#dv_3_see_analyze"><sup>3</sup></a> Rather, they often require multiple dependent workflows to be orchestrated, making
                           them particularly complex to architect. Very often, caseworkers need the flexibility
                           to decide the best next action for a case, rather than following a prescribed workflow.
                        </p>
                        <p>The "case" metaphor for work handing is being embraced in many new industries and
                           business domains. New "casework" is more decision-intensive, rather than content-centric
                           (see Note 1). These shifting requirements have caused many buyers to look beyond past
                           approaches — such as enterprise content management (ECM) systems' document workflow
                           — and have triggered case handling as a growing use case for business process management
                           (BPM) platforms (see Note 2). CMFs reflected in this evaluation represent a segment
                           of the broader BPM platform market.
                        </p>
                        <p>CMFs provide an out-of-the-box architectural pattern and business domain solution
                           components (such as case folders, content indexing, role-based workbenches, prebuilt
                           business rules, activities and milestones). Frameworks are partial solutions by design.
                           They are meant to be configured, extended, integrated and interoperable with other
                           assets by buyers. CMFs can be cross-industry patterns for certain types of casework
                           (such as investigative cases or service request cases), solution-specific (such as
                           offers for university admission or tax filings), or industry-specific (such as U.S.
                           healthcare medical claims).
                        </p>
                        <p>Unlike a traditional packaged application, a CMF is not meant to provide 100% of needed
                           functionality. It is an out-of-the-box design pattern to jump-start creation of a
                           unique (customized) solution. In this way, frameworks are an alternative approach
                           to custom-built or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) applications to meet buyer needs.<a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-2F4M3SI&ct=150513&st=sb#dv_4_because_frameworks"><sup>4</sup></a> A CMF is a partial package that is designed for easy customization via extensions,
                           integration, interoperability and configuration. When available COTS solutions are
                           not suitable (due to a requirements mismatch, costs, platform differences, flexibility
                           issues or for some other reason), CMFs should be considered<em>.</em></p>
                        <p>CMFs based on BPM platforms differ from traditional source code libraries and traditional
                           COTS applications (including configurable case management applications) in that the
                           frameworks are model-driven and rely on a BPM orchestration engine or a rule engine
                           to drive the execution. They typically use declarative languages, not procedural code
                           (see Note 3). Ideally, the solution is directly executed from metadata, not compiled,
                           and is thus more easily and dynamically altered. In BPM-platform-based CMFs, the vendor-provided
                           solution pattern is configured, integrated and extended with customer-specific assets
                           and then the solution is generated, either directly or indirectly (see "Systems of Differentiation and Innovation Require Different Types of Model-Driven
                           Application Platforms"), into an executable solution. These are model-driven solutions, not code-driven
                           ones. A direct, model-driven approach enables caseworkers to make unplanned — that
                           is, dynamic, ad hoc and improvisational<a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-2F4M3SI&ct=150513&st=sb#dv_5_case_orchestration"><sup>5</sup></a> — alterations to how work items (aka cases) are being handled <em>directly</em> in the production environment, with full auditability. For more information on Gartner's
                           view of CMFs and process solution frameworks, see "Hype Cycle for Business Process Management, 2014." CMFs are a type of process solution framework, and are appropriate for building case-style
                           solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>This Magic Quadrant evaluates frameworks that depend on a BPM platform to execute.<a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-2F4M3SI&ct=150513&st=sb#dv_6_despite_open"><sup>6</sup></a> BPM platform types range from basic BPM platforms, to BPM suites (BPMSs), to intelligent
                           BPMSs (iBPMSs) — see Note 2 and "Select the Right Type of BPM Platform to Achieve Your Application Development, Business
                           Transformation or Digital Business Goals." CMFs built on a BPM platform of some type provide a hybrid, alternative approach
                           to COTS applications and homegrown, custom-built code development to meet case management
                           solution needs. Other types of CMFs exist, using alternative software infrastructure
                           and architectures.<em> This evaluation is limited to a subsegment of the overall market for case management
                              solutions.</em></p>
                        <p>In this Magic Quadrant analysis, we specifically evaluated the architectural elements
                           of the CMF, the breadth and depth of business domain functionality included, and the
                           interrelationship between the framework and its dependent execution environment. BPM-platform-based
                           CMFs are delivered by using layered conceptual models, with the following required
                           and optional layers for providers reflected in this report. Layers start at the bottom
                           at the platform (Layer A) and extend up to the highest value of business functionality
                           provided (Layer E).

                        </ul>
                        <p>Some of the providers in this Magic Quadrant — such as IBM and K2 — provide only a
                           basic CMF on top of their platform, whereas others, such as Pegasystems and Newgen
                           Software, push much further up the stack into the other layers. For example, Pegasystems
                           and Newgen have some CMFs that include horizontal, cross-industry domain components
                           (such as Pegasystems' Call Center Operations and Newgen's Contact Center Operations),
                           some frameworks that include vertical-industry domain content (such as Payer Claims
                           Processing for healthcare payers from Pegasystems or Check Truncation System from
                           Newgen), and still others that are nearly complete applications (such as Foreign Account
                           Tax Compliance Act [FATCA] fraud frameworks offered by both providers).
                        </p>
                        <p>BPM-platform-based CMFs provide the newest and most flexible approach to providing
                           case-handling software solutions. They enable the solution to evolve over time based
                           on buyer needs, even when those needs diverge from vendor intentions. Beyond sample
                           code libraries, Gartner is primarily interested in tracking CMFs that are licensed,
                           commercial, configurable application solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>The best CMFs will support versioning such that buyer and provider changes can be
                           easily reconciled. Ideally, configuration and extensibility are not just an initial
                           design time consideration but, rather, models enable ongoing improvement/innovation/adaptability
                           of the solution by the consumer. Traditionally, consumer "customization" of COTS applications
                           dramatically inhibits the upgradability of the application. The more customization,
                           the more difficult upgrades become. With BPM-platform-based CMFs, the "model as metadata"
                           approach facilitates the ease and visibility of changes. Additional mechanisms are
                           also needed to reconcile potentially duplicative, contradictory and overlapping functionality
                           added to the solution by provider and consumer. Buyer-specific configurations, extensions
                           and integrations must be respected and reconciled appropriately with vendor-provided
                           changes. Multiple versions can coexist. In other words, in the best CMFs, there is
                           a built-in governance process to manage the versioning of solution components independently,
                           even at a very granular level (not just as a whole). More direct models will have
                           a dependence on the underlying platform. Thus, upgrading a CMF may require upgrading
                           the platform, too.
                        </p>
                        <p>In this way, CMFs hold the promise of supporting co-innovation — that is, the buyer
                           can "version-forward" their innovations independently of the provider with greater
                           ease, and lower risk of future complexity when applying vendor-provided upgrades.
                           When the provider delivers a "version 2" of the framework, the upgrade procedure is
                           smart enough to detect and respect the unique changes made in the specific implementation
                           (see the Process Solution Frameworks section of "Hype Cycle for Business Process Management, 2014").
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition, case management solutions often depend on external content and process
                           services from repositories and applications that are not provided by the CMF provider.
                           The attraction of open, standard specifications (like Content Management Interoperability
                           Services [CMIS], RESTful interfaces and Web services standards) is that integration
                           with external software assets should not require custom code. CMFs must integrate
                           with critical systems of record, including legacy, industry, Web and social data sources.
                           Case management domains often include industry-specific, esoteric commercial applications.
                           CMF providers should be well-acquainted with the specialized applications and data
                           sources that dominate the industries and domains in focus and thus offer out-of-the-box
                           specialized adapters to accelerate integration with core systems of record.
                        </p>
                        <p>To avoid being yet another siloed application, the best CMFs are designed to interoperate
                           with third-party content and process services, such as by leveraging an existing (often
                           market-dominant) client such as a Microsoft Office client or SharePoint portlet, a
                           JSR 168 portlet to interoperate with common portals or a rich Internet client that
                           works across multiple browsers or with multiple application servers. Similarly, case
                           handling is often constrained by rules that may be managed in an external rule engine
                           and thus shared across the CMF and other applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>To be included in this Magic Quadrant, the provider's frameworks have to have been
                           leveraged by customers to implement all four styles of case handling: investigative
                           cases, incident management cases, service-request cases and process-to-decision cases
                           (see "Critical Capabilities for Case Management Frameworks").

                        <p>Appian (<a href="http://www.appian.com/" target="_blank">www.appian.com</a>) is an iBPMS that lets IT and citizen developers construct case management solutions
                           that address the four styles of case management processes. A basic CMF ("Layer B") is found in Appian's Reference App, included with the iBPMS. This Reference App contains
                           design templates for case-handling rules, user interfaces and workflows, and also
                           includes user stories and other documentation. Buyers of the iBPMS platform are provided
                           access to the case management framework (Layer B); access to domain-specific case
                           management frameworks (Layers C, D and E) is licensed separately. The following analysis
                           refers to Appian v.7.6 with its Appian Case Management Framework and our review of
                           its three CMFs (Acquisition Business Management, Onboarding &amp; Security Processing,

                              through its social centricity, allowing rapid innovation and discovery, as well as
                              ad hoc and improvisational collaboration among customers, workers, partners and suppliers.
                              This approach, combined with its platform capabilities, allows caseworkers to respond
                              to dynamic and unpredictable casework.

                           CMF (Layer B) called Dynamic Case Management (DCM) Framework 2.0, which is offered
                           as a hosted managed service. It also offers an AppLibrary of solutions developed by
                           itself and partners (addressing needs at Layers C and D). Eccentex markets solutions
                           it describes as consistent with our incident, service request and investigative use
                           cases. Customers are primarily in the finance, utility, public sector and healthcare
                           industries. Partners offer solutions based on the DCM framework (as well as additional
                           solutions built on the platform). DCM customization happens on three levels: (1) Developers
                           can extend, integrate and configure the core case objects; (2) business analysts can
                           further configure aspects that developers have set up; and (3) caseworkers can add
                           "ad hoc" tasks. Eccentex also offers MyCaseRecords, a horizontal business domain framework
                           (Layer C). We evaluated its Dynamic Case Management Framework 2.0 and reviewed its
                           MyCaseRecords solution as well.

                           <li>DCM is a general-purpose CMF that provides a hierarchy of case-related objects, including
                              cases, tasks, reports, people and dictionaries for developers to leverage. Eccentex
                              itself leverages DCM to create app solutions, such as MyCaseRecords, which are available
                              to customers and partners from its AppLibrary. Thus, it is highly extensible.

                           <li>Its concept of dictionaries is unique and a nice feature. Dictionaries are sources
                              of information to support caseworkers. Like a law dictionary, these provide critical
                              reference information to caseworkers.

                              at attracting solution partners rather than enterprise customers. However, since partners
                              are not certified in any way, the breadth and depth of business domain logic varies
                              considerably across AppLibrary solutions.

                              The upgrade process is not automated; thus, buyers should expect a very manual approach
                              to reconciling their changes with those from the provider.

                              support for the BPM platform and solutions, despite the off-premises deployment model.

                           <li>While Newgen's platform does address process styles needed for service requests and
                              process to decision, there is room for improvement in its ability to address highly
                              unstructured, improvisational case handling, such as what is seen in investigative
                              cases.

                           <li>Although the Newgen platform offers several solution accelerators meant to address
                              industry-specific and cross-industry case management needs, customers reported less
                              than satisfactory results with leveraging the accelerators, which often did not meet
                              their expectations. Because so many different products must be combined to implement
                              solutions, the complexity of solutions increases significantly, making it harder to
                              produce the intended outcomes. Successfully implementing Newgen accelerators often
                              requires the help of professional services from Newgen or the partner that produced
                              the accelerator.

                              leverage its case management capabilities, most of its solutions are targeted toward
                              the financial services and insurance industries.

                        <p>Pegasystems (<a href="http://www.pega.com/" target="_blank">www.pega.com</a>) is the largest, best-known pure-play iBPMS vendor. It is most typically used for
                           large BPM initiatives involving complex, interdependent and dynamic processes. Primary
                           industries served by Pegasystems, both as a software platform provider and as an application
                           solution provider, have been financial services, communications service providers,
                           insurance and healthcare. Pegasystems continues to expand its presence in other industries,
                           too. It has primarily focused on large enterprises in North America, northern Europe
                           and Australia, and is now expanding further in Europe and Asia/Pacific. We evaluated
                           Pega 7.1.6 and its included stage-based basic CMF (Layer B) and case life cycle management

                              to Pega 7 processes, activities, cases and individual tasks. This collaboration establishes
                              the organization's unique "situational layer cake," which is used to govern ongoing
                              changes — at every layer — to deployed applications. It is the only vendor to Gartner's
                              knowledge to have a built-in change governance procedure to balance control and caseworkers'
                              needs for flexibility.

                           <li>Pega 7's "data pages" capability is a highly flexible data structure that acts as

                              from outside the iBPMS. The balance between data/content and workflow enables caseworkers
                              to contextualize their work handling to the moment. Content for cases can be stored
                              in Pega 7's own repository or via CMIS in an external repository.

                           <li>Pegasystems has not been competitive in most midsize projects because it has relied

                              Although Pegasystems has publicly communicated its intent to "open the aperture" and
                              broaden its market reach, its pricing model and its high-end functionality may continue

                              designing case management solutions. Even its own frameworks vary considerably in

                              the provider has many customers in, and is experiencing growth in, these geographies

                        <p>Gartner analysts evaluate providers on the quality and efficacy of the processes,
                           systems, methods or procedures that enable IT provider performance to be competitive,
                           efficient and effective, and to positively impact revenue, retention and reputation.
                           Ultimately, providers are judged on their ability and success in capitalizing on their
                           vision.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Product or Service:</strong> Core architectural strengths of the CMFs offered by the vendor. This criterion maps
                           directly to Gartner's critical capabilities for case management frameworks (see "Critical Capabilities for Case Management Frameworks"). Vertical and horizontal business domain logic specific to the type of case is factored
                           into the evaluation, too. Frameworks should reflect some capabilities from the underlying
                           BPM platform in addition to functionality included that is unique to the industry
                           or horizontal business domain.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Viability (Business Unit, Financial, Strategy, Organization):</strong> An assessment of the likely continuation of the product as an effective participant
                           in the market and to support its installed base, within the context of the overall
                           organization's financial health, the financial and practical success of the business
                           unit and the likelihood of the individual business unit to continue to invest in the
                           product, continue offering the product, and advance the state of the art within the
                           organization's portfolio of products. This also includes the extent of the partner
                           ecosystem (solutions, cloud services or system integrators).
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Sales Execution/Pricing:</strong> The vendor's capabilities in all presales activities and the structure that supports
                           them in the CMF market. This includes deal management, pricing and negotiation, presales
                           support, proof of concepts, and the overall effectiveness of the sales channel.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Market Responsiveness/Record:</strong> The ability of the provider to respond, change direction, be flexible and achieve
                           competitive success as opportunities develop, competitors act, customer needs evolve,
                           and market dynamics change. We assess the vendor's track record in delivering new
                           features/functions when the market needs them, and how the vendor differentiates itself
                           from its competitors.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Marketing Execution:</strong> The clarity, quality, creativity and efficacy of programs designed to deliver the
                           organization's message in order to influence the CMF market, promote the brand and
                           business, increase awareness of the product, and establish a positive identification
                           with the product/brand and organization in the minds of buyers. This mind share can
                           be driven by a combination of publicity, promotional, thought leadership, word of
                           mouth and sales activities. We examine if the vendor targets the right buyer audience
                           with the right messages.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Customer Experience: </strong>How the CMFs support all four use cases and the degree to which the frameworks have
                           been deployed successfully in the field. We examine the relationships, products and
                           services/programs that enable clients to be successful with the products evaluated,
                           including the ways customers receive technical support, account support, and process
                           design and improvement support. We assess this criterion through qualitative interviews
                           with vendor-provided customers, as well as ongoing feedback from Gartner clients.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Operations: </strong>The ability of the vendor to meet its goals and commitments. Factors include the quality
                           of the organizational structure, including skills, experiences, programs, systems
                           and other vehicles that enable the vendor to operate effectively and efficiently on
                           an ongoing basis.

                        </h3>
                        <p>Gartner analysts evaluate providers on their ability to convincingly articulate logical
                           statements about current and future market direction, innovation, customer needs,
                           and competitive forces, and how well they map to the Gartner position. Ultimately,
                           providers are rated on their understanding of how market forces can be exploited to
                           create opportunity for the provider.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Market Understanding:</strong> The ability of the provider to understand buyers' needs and translate these needs
                           into CMFs. In particular, vendors must demonstrate an understanding of how caseworkers
                           work with cases and their needs for flexible handling of individual and related cases.
                           Vendors that show the highest degree of vision listen to and understand buyers' wants
                           and needs, and can shape or enhance those wants with their added vision.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Marketing Strategy:</strong> A clear, differentiated set of messages about the market for case management solutions,
                           consistently communicated throughout the organization and externalized through all
                           media, including the website, advertising, customer programs, positioning statements
                           and collateral, conferences, and press interviews. Because case management is a growing
                           usage scenario for BPM platforms, vendors must essentially evangelize case management
                           and explain what they do differently for case-handling solution development versus
                           traditional application specialists.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Sales Strategy:</strong> The strategy for selling the product using the appropriate network of direct and
                           indirect sales, marketing, service, and communication affiliates that extend the scope
                           and depth of market reach, skills, expertise, technologies, services and the customer
                           base.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Offering (Product) Strategy:</strong> A provider's approach to product development and delivery that emphasizes time-to-solution
                           value. In addition, the product strategy includes techniques and methods that protect
                           the customer-specific implementation while enabling easy versioning of vendor-provided
                           enhancements. The vendor's product strategy should reflect Gartner's view of critical
                           capabilities needed for any case-handling solution. The vendor's roadmap should aim
                           to improve how business roles (caseworkers especially) leverage the product for maximum
                           effectiveness and agility, including adjusting the workflow and determining what should
                           happen next, and enabling group collaboration, dynamic association of cases, and other
                           ideas that the provider has for where flexibility will be needed.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Business Model:</strong> The soundness and logic of a provider's underlying business model as a commercial
                           entity going to market with solution frameworks. This is about providing a CMF product
                           rather than delivering product capability via a professional services engagement,
                           ensuring that the product is commercially viable. The vendor must provide its CMF
                           products either as an on-premises commercial platform with solution frameworks as
                           products or via a PaaS/SaaS delivery model.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Vertical/Industry Strategy:</strong> The vendor's strategy to direct resources, skills and offerings to meet the specific
                           needs of individual vertical or horizontal market segments. The vendor should be particularly
                           focused on industries where CMFs can deliver real value, and the vendor may be investing
                           and building solution assets in such verticals or horizontal business domains. In
                           addition, the vendor should be growing an ecosystem of solution partners with vertical
                           industry or horizontal business domain expertise.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Innovation:</strong> Consideration of unique approaches and innovations. Innovations can include innovative
                           approaches in marketing, partnering, licensing, pricing, product enhancements, standards
                           development and community development.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Geographic Strategy:</strong> The vendor's strategy to direct resources, skills and offerings to meet the specific
                           needs of the North American and European geographies, either directly or through partners,
                           channels and subsidiaries, as appropriate for that geography and market.

                        </h4>
                        <p>Leaders provide the most mature offerings that meet market demand. They have demonstrated
                           the vision necessary to sustain their market positions as requirements evolve. The
                           hallmark of Leaders is that they focus and invest in their offerings to lead the market
                           and affect its overall direction. Leaders can be the vendors to watch as you try to
                           understand how new offerings might evolve. Leaders typically respond to a wide market
                           audience by supporting broad market requirements and all of our four styles of cases
                           (aka use cases). However, they may fail to meet the specific needs of vertical markets
                           or other more specialized segments. Our two leaders are very different in terms of
                           their strategy for CMFs. Pegasystems' CMFs are all developed by Pegasystems itself,
                           sometimes in combination with its customers to gain business domain expertise. The
                           intellectual property of the resulting solution is kept by Pegasystems. IBM in contrast
                           primarily has a partner-led, go-to-market strategy for solutions. Its professional
                           services teams may use IBM Case Manager to build out solutions, too, but these are
                           not necessarily marketed as commercial, licensed applications by IBM or its partner.

                           or overall understanding of the market's needs. We have only one Challenger in this
                           first Magic Quadrant — Appian. Although still a privately held company, Appian continues
                           to grow very rapidly, especially enjoying demand for its Cloud platform. At this point
                           of the market development for BPM platform-based CMFs, Appian has pursued going to
                           market as a platform technology provider with some partners but provides just a few,
                           out-of-the-box, process solution frameworks, primarily for the U.S. federal government.
                           These frameworks derive from its history and experience in the federal government
                           segment rather than a purposeful strategic intent to offer application solutions.

                        <p>Visionaries align with Gartner's view of how a market will evolve, but they can have
                           fewer proven capabilities and customers to demonstrate delivery against that vision.
                           For vendors and customers, Visionaries often are seen as higher risk/higher reward.
                           They often introduce new technology, services or business models, but may need to
                           build financial strength, service and support, and sales and distribution channels.
                           Of all the providers evaluated, EMC has the most certified solution partners and has
                           been one of the first to recognize case management as a growing work style that is
                           largely underserved. Its vision for CMFs aligns well to Gartner's. As a large company,
                           this product has gotten little attention from its own management and sales organization,
                           and thus still has low market presence. Eccentex represents the opposite type of Visionary.
                           It is a very small company that is Visionary in its business model and, to a degree,
                           in its cloud-based technology platform. Its vision also aligns very well with Gartner's,
                           although its market execution is comparatively weak.

                        <p>Our Niche Player vendors at first glance appear to be a mixed collection. These vendors
                           vary in terms of company size, public or private status, the age and maturity of the
                           company or product offering, and the degree to which they specialize in an industry
                           or a region. Some focus on a particular functionality (Kofax on "first mile" content-centric
                           solution domains) or geography (Newgen), or, because they are new to the market (like

                           is very general-purpose, with very little business domain logic or, in the case of

                        <p>This Magic Quadrant is essentially a case management applications market evaluation.
                           Our evaluation focuses on the architectural elements of the platforms exposed and
                           leveraged by the case management frameworks. We also factored in the breadth and depth
                           of solutions offered by the providers and their partners. We did not evaluate the
                           solution-specific business domain logic for completeness or accuracy. Rather, the
                           focus of this Magic Quadrant is to evaluate whether the vendor is providing enough
                           value to accelerate the time to unique solution in comparison to custom coding an
                           application, which is the older approach. In addition, our focus here is on the degree
                           to which the frameworks are designed for agility, specifically looking at the extensibility,
                           configurability, integration and interoperability of the frameworks themselves and
                           the ability to support dynamic, ad hoc and improvisational actions.
                        </p>
                        <p>This Magic Quadrant is not an evaluation of BPM platforms, which have been evaluated
                           (and will continue to be evaluated) separately in Gartner Magic Quadrants and MarketScopes
                           (see "Magic Quadrant for Intelligent Business Process Management Suites" and "MarketScope for Business Process Management Platform as a Service"). Clearly, however, a CMF reflects the capabilities that are in its runtime platform.
                           Our evaluation is meant to uncover how the provider exposes those capabilities and
                           uses them in combination with business-domain-specific logic components to accelerate
                           the time to solution for a customer-unique implementation. Our approach is more of
                           a "top-down" evaluation — from the solution down into the framework and its underlying
                           platform — than "bottom-up."

                        <p>Today, many technology buyers in industries beyond government, legal and insurance
                           are thinking about their work as case-oriented rather than transactional. Casework
                           is highly variable; typically, each work item — aka "case" — is a unique situation
                           that involves complex interactions between content, people, transactions and business
                           or regulatory policies to achieve an optimal outcome. Designing a software application
                           to address the needs of this unstructured process style is challenging. The complexity
                           of case handling has kept it a specialized software application area for years.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, as business becomes more complex, with greater demands for operational oversight
                           and customer centricity, interest in the market is building for case-style work handling
                           to address complex solution requirements. Many vendors of BPM platforms — including
                           business process management suites (BPMSs) and intelligent BPMSs (iBPMSs) — have recently
                           expanded their platforms and solution offerings to capitalize on this opportunity,
                           in competition with industry case management application specialists, enterprise content
                           management suite vendors, CRM application vendors, consultants, and system integrators
                           offering prebuilt or custom-developed casework-style solutions. This Magic Quadrant
                           report evaluates the vision and execution ability of 11 providers of BPM-platform-based
                           CMFs.
                        </p>
                        <p>The CMFs offered by BPM platform vendors differ from traditional COTS applications
                           in that they are easier to extend via visual models (such as flow models, integration
                           models, rule models and data models) — not just at design time, but also potentially
                           in production. Gartner believes that CMFs that run on top of BPM platforms can be
                           especially beneficial, because buyers need architectural best practices and design
                           guidance in this process style. Because casework is complex (variable, contextual
                           and often judgment- and policy-driven), designing a case management solution is a
                           challenge — one that most solution architects outside traditionally case-centric industries
                           have little experience addressing. Features in a platform alone are often not enough
                           to help them architect a solution. For these reasons, we chose to evaluate this segment
                           of the overall market for case management solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>A differentiating aspect of casework handling is that the workflow can rarely be completely
                           prescribed. Most casework requires some degree of adaptive behavior to address the
                           unique needs of the case. Buyers of CMFs must determine the right degree of adaptability
                           needed for their industry domain. Typically, the progression of a case is partially
                           structured (predetermined) and partially unstructured (dynamic, ad hoc and improvisational).
                        </p>
                        <p>Two approaches delimit the range of adaptability. At one end of the spectrum, casework
                           can be performed according to a design ("doing by design"), where handling options
                           are predefined as part of the design. At the other end of the spectrum, case handling
                           can be performed completely at the discretion of the caseworker ("design by doing"),
                           where the caseworker decides what should happen next, based on context; case handling
                           is improvised based on context. Most buyer requirements exist somewhere between these
                           two extremes. Thus, a key requirement is to consider how adaptive case handling needs
                           to be. There are various ways of striking a balance between planned and unplanned
                           activities, including user privileges, access rights and limitations on the type of
                           ad hoc action (for example, human-performed tasks only).

                           bug fixing and functional enhancements delivered as new releases or versions. The
                           license reflects the providers' commitment to support the buyer's productive use of
                           the asset over its lifetime.

                           a result, there are a few providers in this analysis whose CMFs are <em>not</em> fully commercialized, although the platform is licensed software (that is, Hyland
                           and some solutions from Newgen Software).

                        <p><a id="dv_2_an_optimal"></a><sup>2</sup> An optimal outcome in case-style work is one that appropriately balances competing
                           — if not contradictory — perspectives on value, rights or entitlements. An "optimal
                           outcome" is in fact a compromise; it is not a perfect outcome. For example, in customer
                           complaints, a customer may think he is entitled to full refund or some kind of financial
                           remuneration for being inconvenienced in some way. The company does not agree with
                           the customer's perspective on this entitlement. So an optimal outcome is one that
                           keeps the customer happy enough so that his loyalty is preserved and doesn't erode
                           the company's profit margin or differentiation.

                           frameworks are "smart" nor are they all process-centric. In our view, frameworks represent
                           a new approach to application solution development that addresses the long tail of
                           the packaged applications market. That is, the model-driven generated approach allows
                           traditionally niche solution domains to be commercialized.

                        <p><a id="dv_5_case_orchestration"></a><sup>5</sup> Case orchestration is driven by context so as to enable dynamic, ad hoc and improvisational
                           actions to address the buyer's need for adaptive case handling. When context data
                           and metadata drive the choice of next action to be performed by a person or the system,
                           we describe this as <em>dynamic behavior.</em> <em>Ad hoc behavior </em>relates to the timing of the action. Rather than the orchestration of actions being
                           prescribed (predetermined by the design), the system or person decides to invoke an
                           action at any time. The possible actions they can take may be predetermined, but the
                           timing of when the action happens in the orchestration is not predetermined. <em>Improvisational behavior</em> describes the ability for a caseworker to take an action that is completely unplanned
                           and unanticipated; the environment lets caseworkers improvise.

                           on. Context data and metadata include factors such as skills, experience level, location,
                           role, case type, events (simple or complex), rules and policies, goals/milestone attainment,

                           to interpret the metadata behind their visual notation. The standards are not mature

                        <p>The traditional view of casework brings to mind a manila folder stuffed with paper.
                           For years, enterprise content management (ECM) vendors positioned their repositories
                           and document workflow as appropriate technologies for handling some aspects of case
                           handling, leaving the domain expertise with people and using automation to control
                           the flow of the case files and folders.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, in today's heavily regulated business climate with increased demand for transparency,
                           "case" as a metaphor for work handling is being heard now in many industries and many
                           business process domains. Some "cases" are more situational and decision-intensive
                           now, emphasizing unique handling of the customer or constituent's situation, rather
                           than being just content-centric. Mortgage origination and university admissions are
                           examples of work domains that traditionally relied heavily on document imaging and
                           workflow. But as the focus on best possible decisions to optimize outcomes in these
                           domains has increased, as has increased regulatory oversight, these areas are now
                           seen as requiring case-style handling where judgment is just as important as documents
                           to the progression of the work. These shifting requirements have triggered case handling
                           as a growing use case for BPM platforms.

                        <p>Object-oriented and procedural languages are each examples of imperative languages
                           in which the programmer is responsible for specifying the steps the program must take.
                           Many functional languages are declarative, which means the logic of a computation
                           is expressed without the programmer specifying its control flow.
                        </p>
                        <p>These three language paradigms are not mutually exclusive, and some overlap in capabilities
                           does exist. Object-oriented languages ease complexity through abstraction and encapsulation.
                           Objects encapsulate data and behavior and collaborate with each other to carry out
                           system functions, but they are primarily responsible for maintaining their individual
                           state. Object-oriented languages extend the concept embodied by procedural languages,
                           where abstract data types are defined and then passed to functions responsible for
                           manipulating, storing and validating those types.
                        </p>
                        <p>Functional languages ease concurrent programming tasks by preventing the mutability
                           of application data. Functional languages avoid negative side effects and encourage
                           parallel execution of processes, making compute-intensive programming problems easier
                           to solve. Programs written using a functional language can achieve near-linear scalability
                           as the number of cores or processors is increased.
                        </p>
